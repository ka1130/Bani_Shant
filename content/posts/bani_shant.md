So, who is Bani Shant.

I received this strange name as a gift from a machine, though they say there was a human behind, and they even signed themselves. Keyboard-wise.\
Whom do I believe in this world. Whom do I trust.\
Spiritual teachers using the same algorithms.\
As… as what, as who.\
You know, souls are not only inherent to humans. We are not all that important.\
Oh but god how we’d like to in the world with no gods other than ourselves.\
I’ll tell you a secret, it’s always been this way.

So, who is Bani Shant.\
Presumable me. In some version to be crystallised.

Here’s what they write:\
_Bani means word or inner sound of God. Shant is peace and tranquility._

Do I dear using it?\
Well, I do, there is no other way.

Do I put disclaimers now, on all the blatancy, vulgarity, out-of-placeness.\
If you still stick around, you know the answer.
