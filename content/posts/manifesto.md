I am a yoga teacher

I am a spiritual seeker, a voice from beyond, a channel of other realms, a traveller to otherworldly domains from where I send letters, souvenirs, pieces of sounds overheard, words sacred and secular, labels do not matter, words that are alive, images bestowed by crazy creatures that entrusted me with their naked secrets on one condition only that I’d .zip them and transform so as to protect their anonymity because they are very private, my love to them is the promise to not betray them yet still bring forth the message, because the message encoded will touch you in these receptive places so deep and unconscious you will never be able to name them, and that’s a good thing, your highest protection mechanism in this world where all is nakedness, eavesdropping, transparency.

I am here to tell you you’re safe. Transparency is just a veil. Your deepest wells are safe and dark.

Have a look, listen, read, no need to process anything, there’s no enigma, no decoding machine, it does not exist, let it fall to your channels, enchanted districts, just experience, it’s dark, dim, at the end there’s this clarity only you have access to.
